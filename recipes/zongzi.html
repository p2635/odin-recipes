    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      A traditional Chinese rice dish made of glutinous rice stuffed with
      different fillings and wrapped in bamboo leaves (generally of the species
      Indocalamus tessellatus), or sometimes with reed or other large flat
      leaves.
    </p>
    <p>
      They are cooked by steaming or boiling. People in the Eastern world often
      translate this dish into English as rice dumplings or sticky rice
      dumplings, although the Chinese government has registered Zongzi as the
      formal name in global use.
